                        <h2 style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><br> There are four main types of disease:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li> infectious disease </li>
                            <li> deficiency disease</li>

                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h3>What are infectious diseases?</h3>
                        <p>Infectious diseases can be caused by many pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and
                            parasites that may cause illness and disease. For humans, transmission of pathogens may
                            occur in a variety of ways: spread from person-to-person by direct contact, water or
                            foodborne illness or aerosolization of infected particles in the environment and through
                            insects (<a

                            and <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/7234-tick-bites"
                                target="_blank">ticks</a>.</p>
                        <p>Signs and symptoms and treatment of infectious diseases depend on the host and the pathogen.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What are deficiency disease?</h3>
                        <p>A deficiency disease can be defined as a disease which is caused by the lack of essential
                            nutrients or dietary elements such as vitamins and minerals in the human body. Deficiency
                            disease examples: Vitamin B1 deficiency causes beriberi, lack of iron in the body can lead
                            to anaemia.</p>
                        <h3>What are genetic disease?</h3>
                        <p>A genetic disorder is a disease caused in whole or in part by a change in the DNA sequence
                            away from the normal sequence. Genetic disorders can be caused by a mutation in one gene
                            (monogenic disorder ), by mutations in multiple genes(multifactorial inheritance disorder),
                            by a combination of gene mutations and environmental factors, or by damage to chromosomes
                            (changes in the number or structure of entire chromosomes, the structures that carry genes).
                        </p>
                        <h3>What are physiological disease?</h3>
                        <p>A physiological disorder is a condition in which the organs in the body malfunction causes
                            illness. Examples are Asthma, Glaucoma, Diabetes. <br>

                            Physiological Disorders is normally caused when the normal or proper functioning of the body
                            is affected because the bodys organs have malfunctioned, not working or the actual cellular
                            structures have changed over a period of time causing illness. Therefore the majority of
                            diseases and ailments you will be able to name as they fall under the physiological category

                        <p class="content">This is not only due not only
                            to an absence of disease. Regular exercise,
                            balanced nutrition, and adequate rest all contribute to good health. People receive medical

                            endurance of a personâ€™s breathing and heart function, muscular strength, flexibility, and
                            body composition.This means that health is a resource to support an individualâ€™s function in

                            the digital society</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <P>The digital society allows
                            different perspectives to co-exist and dynamically evolve in the
                            different forms of online environment. Subsequently, the different views on health are
                            present online in the same time, competing for attention of the visitors, users, and
                            creators of the digital content. Some of these ideas, although seemingly new and appealing,
                            frequently represent refurbished historical concepts. Moreover, every public health-related
                            intervention should consider its online context. To be able to identify and recognize the
                            individual understanding of health is important, in particular when this conception of
                            health contradicts recommendations for diseases that need medical intervention.</P>
                        <P>The plurality of health definitions reflects the variety of contexts in which health is
                            elaborated. A concept â€˜home contextâ€™ is the context in which the concept originates. It
                            makes sense predominantly inside but not necessarily outside its home context.
                            Conceptualizing is a verbal act that sets out to identify and shape phenomenaâ€™s border and
                            content. The conceptualization localizes and attributes identity, content, or meaning. The
                            definitions of health obviously reflect socially and culturally constructed and tentative
                            categories. The relation between an individual and society is implied in most concepts of
                            health. In particular, in the digital environment, critical analysis of health concepts
                            helps us to understand better health policies and politics and their consequences. As they
                            frequently represent societal powers rather than phenomenological differences, they are
                            accordingly accepted, criticized, or even rejected.</P>

                        <p class="content">Mental and physical health
                            are probably the two most frequently discussed
                            types of health.

                            Spiritual, emotional, and financial health also contribute to overall health. Medical
                            experts have linked these to lower stress levels and improved mental and physical
                            well-being. <br>

                            People with better financial health, for example, may worry less about finances and have the
                            means to buy fresh food more regularly. Those with good spiritual health may feel a sense of
                            calm and purpose that fuels good mental health. <br> <br> </p>
